# TravelCompany_Bootcamp_ED
1st Individual Exercise for Code.hub's Jakarta/Angular Bootcamp.
The project was built  using:
- Java 21
java version "21.0.3" 2024-04-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 21.0.3+7-LTS-152)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.3+7-LTS-152, mixed mode, sharing)
- the Apache Netbeans IDE
- the Git version control and GitHub to upload the project

The project is operable and uses the file sample-lorem-ipsum-text-file 
in the directory files/txt/ to generate a .xml file called parsedTxt.xml
and then reads and stores it in the memory so it can accomplish
the requirements of the Exercise. The .xml and .xsd files generated are
save in the directory files/xml/.

For the time being there is a .java File I couldn't delete
due to some technical difficulties with the IDE. I am
refering to the txtToXmlParseService.java file which
is an outdated version of the TxtToXmlParseService.java file
that never got erased and isn't used in the project.
